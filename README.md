# Weather-Forecast-App

Weather forecast app for Android.

By building this project I learned:
- work with public API
- use query and path parameters with Retrofit
- work with runtime permissions
- get user location
- use MockK

I get current weather data from free API: <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api" target="_blank">OpenWeather</a>
